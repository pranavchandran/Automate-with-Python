Multithreading

To introduce the concept of multithreading, letâ€™s look at an example situation.
Say you want to schedule some code to run after a delay or at a specific time.
You could add code like the following at the start of your program:
'''

import time, datetime

# starttime = datetime.datetime(2029, 10, 31, 0, 0, 0)

# while datetime.datetime.now() < starttime:
#     time.sleep(1)
# print('program now starting on Halloween 2029')
